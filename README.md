# Requirements of Assignment

*"First, brainstorm what program you want to build. You may want to think about solving a problem that either you or someone else has. Remember that you can make use of various libraries and APIs to build very powerful programs. The complexity of the project should be roughly similar to that of the graded project in the previous sprint.
If you have an idea that really interests you but which seems too big and complicated for this project, you can also try to build a minimalistic part of it. Ideally, it would still work and do at least a part of what the final program would do. Such minimal versions of projects are usually called MVPs â€“ Minimum Viable Products."*

## Running Project

- There is a requirement.txt file to get you started. There is also    some data still located in the file during testing. This was intended    to stay in the file as a way to show the product without the need to    go through the entire process.

 - Due to the nature of the project the utilization 'send email'    function, will not work without email and password of a sender.

- The project was created intended as a personal tool as is not fully optimized for multiple users. The use of JSON and the object structure, will allow for future addition of this feature but was intentionally not included with the current version.
